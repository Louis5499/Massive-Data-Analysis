# Introduction to Massive Data Analysis
NTHU CS 573200. Course Instructor: Wang, Jia-Shung
The courses' materials are inherited from Stanford CS246: Mining Massive Data Sets

There're four homeworks during the courses, all of which use MapReduce to solve the problem:

1. Matrix Multiplication
Given two 500x500 matrix and calculate the product result.

2. Page Rank
Calculate the page rank over a simulated network

3. Kmeans
Calculate the Kmeans and cluster the data

4. LSH
Calculate the similarity metric - LSH of 100 documents

Finally, I've implemented the Final Project - Recommendation System based on consine similarity.
